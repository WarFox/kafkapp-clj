# warfox/kafkapp-clj

This is a collection of Kafka Producer and Consumer example apps written in Clojure.

## Consumer

There are three types of Consumers

- JSON, Avro, Transactional

## Producer

There are three types of Producers

- JSON, Avro, Tranactional

## Installation

Download from https://github.com/warfox/kafkapp-clj

## Confluent Local

Setup `confluent` cli by downloading latest TAR file from confluent webisite.

Set the `$CONFLUENT_HOME` and add `$CONFLUENT_HOME/bin` to you `$PATH`

Start your local confluent services by running

```sh
confluent local services start
```

### Setup topics

Setup the topics using the following

```sh
./bin/setup-topics.sh
```

## Usage

Run the producer:

```sh
 clj -M:run producer -c avro -t pageviews
 clj -M:run producer -c json -t pageviews
 clj -M:run producer -c transactional -t pageviews
```

Run the consumer

```sh
 clj -M:run consumer -c avro -t pageviews
 clj -M:run consumer -c json -t pageviews
 clj -M:run consumer -c transactional -t pageviews
```

## Build

Run the project's tests (they'll fail until you edit them):

```sh
$ clojure -T:build test
```

Run the project's CI pipeline and build an uberjar (this will fail until you edit the tests to pass):

    $ clojure -T:build ci

This will produce an updated `pom.xml` file with synchronized dependencies inside the `META-INF`
directory inside `target/classes` and the uberjar in `target`. You can update the version (and SCM tag)
information in generated `pom.xml` by updating `build.clj`.

If you don't want the `pom.xml` file in your project, you can remove it. The `ci` task will
still generate a minimal `pom.xml` as part of the `uber` task, unless you remove `version`
from `build.clj`.

Run that uberjar:

    $ java -jar target/com.github.warfox/kafkapp-clj-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
